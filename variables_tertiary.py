# Choose a song that you enjoy listening to. For this song you should pull up the lyrics.
# I suggest using Genius since it breaks down the song's structure into its individual parts.

# --------------- Section 3 --------------- #

# 3.1
# Variables
#   1) Create a variable to represent each part of the song. By parts, I mean the verses, chorus, bridges, etc. Each
#   part should exist as a string. You may need to use string combination to combine longer verses and choruses.
#
#   Use the newline or \n escape character at the end of every line.
#
# Hint: When combining long strings, it may be nicer to utilize individual lines for each line in a verse or chorus.
# See below for an example. Surround the combination with a (), and then hit enter when the cursor is in between. It
# should make the form you see below of:
#
# variable = (
#    'lyrics go here'
# )
#
# Anything between these () are included in the operation.

example_verse = (
    'round your city, round the clock\n' +
    'everybody needs you\n' +
    'no, you can\'t make everybody equal\n'
)

# 3.2
# Print
#   1) Print the variables out so that they form the song in correct order when outputted to the terminal.
#   2) Insert blank print statements so that there is a blank line in between different verses / choruses.
#
#   Remember you can re-use variables (like the chorus) if it's the same.
